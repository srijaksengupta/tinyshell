# tinyshell
Developed a bash shell model using C++ by implementing fork in order to create 2 new commands - history and exit. The function of the history command was to display the last 5 commands inputted whereas an extra flag -sbu was also added in order to sort by execution time. The exit command would exit out of the shell.
